This document provides detailed configuration instructions to ensure the application runs smoothly. It explains how to configure the environment, set up the database, start the application, log in, and common troubleshooting issues a user may run into.

## Environment Setup
The following is required to operate the application from a terminal: 
####  **1. Java 24 or Higher**
- **Installing Java 24**: If not already installed, download Java 24 (JDK) from Oracle. Choose the installer based on your specific operating system. (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
  
- **Confirm Java Version**: Once installed (or if you already had Java installed), verify the Java version in the terminal.
  ```bash
  java -version
  ```
  A result similar to "24.0.2" should appear.

####  **2. Maven**
- **Install Maven:** If not already installed, download Maven on Mac OS [(with Homebrew)](https://brew.sh/). Then run the command below in the terminal.
  
  ```bash
  brew install maven
  
- **Confirm Maven Installation:** Verify that Maven is available by using the command below in the terminal.
