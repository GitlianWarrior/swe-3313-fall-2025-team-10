## Requirements


Following an in-depth session with our client, our team was able to pinpoint the key features and functionalities required to achieve a successful implementation.

From there, we established the functional and non-functional requirements for a rare car e-commerce website, allowing users to browse, search, and purchase unique vehicles. Admins are granted features to manage inventory and track sales performance. Requirements are organized by Version, Epic, and Story, with associated priority, estimated effort, and functional/non-functional classifications.
