# SWE 3313 - Fall 2025 - Team 10: The Agile Minds

Welcome to the project repository for Team 10. Here you will find all the artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project.

We will create a small e-commerce website using Java 24, the Spring Framework, and a SQLite database to sell unique, rare cars.

## Requirements


Following an in-depth session with our client, our team was able to pinpoint the key features and functionalities required to achieve a successful implementation.

From there, we established the functional and non-functional requirements for a rare car e-commerce website, allowing users to browse, search, and purchase unique vehicles. Admins are granted features to manage inventory and track sales performance. Requirements are organized by Version, Epic, and Story, with associated priority, estimated effort, and functional/non-functional classifications.

A more thorough overview of the client's requested requirements/features is available [here.](./requirements/README.md)

## User Interface Design


In this section, our team composed a high-fidelity interactive user interface mockup for the e-commerce website using Marvel. The UI design and high fidelity mockup includes every must-have screen the client requires. This includes a login, self-registration, inventory list, shopping cart, checkout, and a sales report screen.
